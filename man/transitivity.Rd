\title{Checking transitivity}
\usage{
transitivity(x, z, gcol="blue", yrange)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Output object of \code{setup}}

\item{z}{Covariate name for assessing transitivity (must be involved in \code{covariate} of the output object of \code{setup}}

\item{gcol}{Color of the plot}

\item{yrange}{Range of y-axis of the plot}
}
\value{
Summary statistics of the covariate among different study designs and its summary plot are presented.
\itemize{
\item \code{coding}: A table that presents the correspondence between the numerical code and treatment categories (the reference category is coded as 1).
\item \code{covariate}: Covariate that specified in \code{setup}.
\item \code{summary}: Summary of the covariate among different study designs. \code{N}: number of the corresponding studies, \code{n}: total sample size, \code{wt.mean}: weighted mean, \code{min}: minimum, \code{max}: maximum.

\description{
To check transitivity on the network, summary statistics of a certain covariate among different study designs are provided. Also, a summary plot for these statistics is presented.
