Description: Network meta-analysis tools based on contrast-based approach using the multivariate meta-analysis and meta-regression models (Noma et al. (2025) <doi:10.1101/2025.09.15.25335823>). Comprehensive analysis tools for network meta-analysis and meta-regression (e.g., synthesis analysis, ranking analysis, and creating league table) are available through simple commands. For inconsistency assessment, the local and global inconsistency tests based on the Higgins' design-by-treatment interaction model are available. In addition, the side-splitting methods and Jackson's random inconsistency model can be applied. Standard graphical tools for network meta-analysis, including network plots, ranked forest plots, and transitivity analyses, are also provided. For the synthesis analyses, the Noma-Hamura's improved REML (restricted maximum likelihood)-based methods (Noma et al. (2023) <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1652> <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1651>) are adopted as the default methods.
