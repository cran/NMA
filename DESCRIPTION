Description: Network meta-analysis tools based on contrast-based approach using the multivariate meta-analysis and meta-regression models (Noma et al. (2023) <Forthcoming>). Standard analysis tools for network meta-analysis and meta-regression (e.g., synthesis analysis, ranking analysis, and creating league table) are available by simple commands. For inconsistency analyses, the local and global inconsistency tests based on the Higgins' design-by-treatment interaction model can be applied. Also, the side-splitting and the Jackson's random inconsistency model are available. Standard graphical tools for network meta-analysis (e.g., network plot, ranked forest plot, and transitivity analysis) can also be utilized. For the synthesis analyses, the Noma-Hamura's improved REML (restricted maximum likelihood)-based methods (Noma et al. (2023) <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1652> <doi:10.1002/jrsm.1651>) are adopted as the default methods.
